FLOWStress is a S/W that can generate stress time series in substructures of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) very efficiently. Unlike Transient response FEAs or Dynamic response FEAs, FLOWStress generates stress time series of FOWT substructures using only stress RAOs and OpenFAST load analysis results. As a result, FLOWStress uses very little storage and computes tens of thousands of times faster than transient response FEAs.

We developers of SOSEL at INHA University have technically verified that FLOWStress results are equivalent to transient response FEA results, so many researchers can use FLOWStress with high confidence.
